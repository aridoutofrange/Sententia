# Sententia
### Sententia - to be sentient

Sententia is a snake and ladder game where the player can play as the newcomers of a dying, yet thriving land named Exurus. Every newcomers have their own quirks and characteristics based on their personalities, but one thing remains the same, they'd do anything avoid entropy.

# Sententia in A Nutshell
There are 2 game modes in Sententia:
- Player vs Player
- Player vs Computer 

Choose one that suits you the best.

After choosing the game mode, you'll be redirected to the characters screen. Here, you can choose one of the newcomers of Exurus as your character. Remember, each of them have their own quirks, which affects the gameplay. Choose them wisely.

FA XXIV, a seeker from Aeneus, will bring you towards the easy game mode, with his own quirks, of course. He's a simple folk and doesn't view life as a hard thing to do, and so his principle of life is represented in the game mode.

Ralune, the engineer with unknown origin, will lead you to the medium game mode, with her own characteristics that'll spice up the gameplay. She's paradoxical to some extent; clear yet complex; so expect that in the game mode.

Phase Quanta, salesman of Cryocoze. Having both experiences of life and death, he will conduct you to the hard game mode, with his own peculiarity as a mannequin-robot hybrid. As entropy was his best friend back in the day, he's unfamiliar with life, seeing it as a complicated, encapsulated thing that separates itself from the world.

Now you might ask, how do I play the game? Well, you'd play it the way you'd play your classic snake and ladder game, except with cards! 
You wait until it's your turn, roll the dice and see how far you'll move. If you happen to stumble across a ladder card, you'll move upward, depending on the ladder card, and if you happen to came across a snake card, you'll move downward, it also depends on the card that you got. Whoever reaches the 100th position first, they'll be the winner of the game.

There will be bonus cards scattered all over the board, use them to your need.
